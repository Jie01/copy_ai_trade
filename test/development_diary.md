# Development Diary

## Project Overview
This diary documents the development process of the Copy AI Trades Flask application, located at `/mnt/c/Users/aukit/PycharmProjects/copy_ai_trades/test`.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Setup
- Created Flask application with application factory pattern
- Implemented blueprint structure for modular routing
- Added basic data parsing functionality for trade and account data

### Data Processing Implementation
- Developed JSON parsing functions to handle API responses
- Implemented PnL calculations for both realized and unrealized gains
- Added symbol-wise breakdown of trading performance

### API Development
- Created RESTful endpoints for trade summaries, account summaries, and overall portfolio view
- Implemented error handling and data validation
- Added health check endpoint for monitoring

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive README with usage instructions
- Documented API endpoints and data structures
- Added data flow explanation for Telegram integration

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- Used Flask application factory for better testability
- Implemented blueprint pattern for route organization
- Kept data processing logic separate from API routes

### Data Handling
- Parsed JSON responses from nof1.ai API
- Calculated comprehensive PnL metrics
- Structured data for easy Telegram formatting

### Dependencies
- Minimal dependencies to keep application lightweight
- Used standard Flask extensions for future scalability

## Challenges Faced

### JSON Parsing Issues
- Encountered malformed JSON in trade data file
- Fixed syntax errors and validated data integrity
- Implemented robust error handling for data loading

### Data Structure Complexity
- Handled nested JSON structures for positions and trades
- Implemented efficient aggregation algorithms
- Ensured accurate calculation of commissions and margins

## Future Improvements

### Database Integration
- Add PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Create historical data analysis features

### Telegram Bot Integration
- Develop automated notification system
- Implement real-time trade alerts
- Add interactive commands for portfolio management

### Advanced Analytics
- Add risk management metrics
- Implement performance visualization
- Create backtesting capabilities

## Code Quality
- Followed PEP 8 style guidelines
- Added type hints for better code maintainability
- Implemented comprehensive error handling

## Testing
- Manual testing of API endpoints
- Validated data parsing accuracy
- Verified PnL calculations against expected values

## Deployment Considerations
- Containerize application with Docker
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add configuration management for different environments
