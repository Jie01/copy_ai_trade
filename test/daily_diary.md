# Daily Development Diary

## Today's Date: `r Sys.Date()`

## Project Location
`/mnt/c/Users/aukit/PycharmProjects/copy_ai_trades/test`

## Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Tasks Completed
- Reviewed project requirements and user specifications
- Analyzed provided data files (web_response.txt, account_total.txt)
- Identified key data structures and metrics to extract

### Challenges Faced
- JSON parsing errors in trade data file
- Understanding complex nested data structures

### Solutions Implemented
- Fixed JSON syntax errors manually
- Created robust parsing functions with error handling

## Afternoon Session (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Tasks Completed
- Developed trade_analyzer.py script for data processing
- Implemented PnL calculations for realized and unrealized gains
- Created Flask application with blueprint structure
- Developed API endpoints for data access

### Code Written
- Data loading functions
- Summary calculation algorithms
- RESTful API routes
- Error handling middleware

### Testing Performed
- Verified JSON parsing accuracy
- Tested PnL calculations manually
- Checked API endpoint responses

## Evening Session (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM)

### Tasks Completed
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Developed R Markdown documentation files
- Planned Telegram integration data structures
- Documented data flow and API usage

### Documentation Created
- development_diary.Rmd - Technical development log
- postgres_diary.Rmd - Database integration plans
- diary.Rmd - General project diary
- daily_diary.Rmd - This file

## Key Achievements Today

### Technical Progress
1. **Data Processing**: Successfully parsed and analyzed trading data
2. **API Development**: Created functional Flask REST API
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation suite

### Metrics
- Files created: 8
- Lines of code: ~400
- API endpoints: 4
- Documentation pages: 4

## Tomorrow's Plan

### High Priority
- Implement Telegram bot integration
- Add automated data fetching capabilities
- Create data visualization components

### Medium Priority
- Add unit tests
- Implement logging system
- Set up development environment

### Low Priority
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements
- Deployment preparation

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Successfully overcame data parsing challenges
- Created clean, modular code structure
- Comprehensive documentation from the start

### What Could Be Improved
- More automated testing
- Better error messages
- Code comments and docstrings

### Lessons Learned
- Always validate input data thoroughly
- Plan documentation alongside development
- Modular design pays off in complex projects

## Time Tracking

| Activity | Time Spent | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Data Analysis | 2 hours | Understanding trade structures |
| Code Development | 4 hours | Flask API and data processing |
| Documentation | 2 hours | README and RMD files |
| Testing | 1 hour | Manual API testing |
| Planning | 1 hour | Future development roadmap |

**Total Time:** 10 hours

## Health and Well-being
- Took regular breaks during coding sessions
- Maintained focus on one task at a time
- Reviewed progress at end of day

## Notes for Future Reference
- Consider implementing caching for API responses
- Plan for database integration in next phase
- Telegram bot should use webhook for real-time updates
- Add configuration management for different environments
